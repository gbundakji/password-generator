# Password Generator 🔒

Welcome! ☺👋

## Description 📝

This is a password generator simply created to generate randomized passwords between 8-128 characters in length including special characters, numerical characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. This simplifies creating secure passwords for your online accounts rather than making passwords that may be unsecure. In creating this generator I have learned a lot about 'if' and 'else' statements and how they work to create a responsive webpage.
